### Morning Lecture

**Question:** How do we create dissatisfaction? Doing things that bring us immediate pleasure versus doing things that we feel good about.

Temporary <u>outside</u> pleasure is very fleeting and can even cause stress.

Looking for happiness in the wrong place can cause suffering. Often, looking for a fix, We go against our own values to give ourselves temporary pleasure.

### Morning Breakout Session

#### Main Question to Contemplate
> How much of our life is focused on pleasure versus meaningful things that we feel good about.

<u>**Intention**</u> makes a world of difference. Example: buying something to support someone or make a difference versus just impulse buying.

Everyday we're bombarded with messages that we're *not enough* but we could be if we just bought *x* product.

#### Questions to Guide Discussion
1. What is meaningful?
2. What do I feel good doing? (*stimulus generated pleasure vs. creating value for the world*)
3. Do I live consistent with my values? (*compassion, honesty, integrity*)
4. How can I be beneficial? (*intention is everything* - example: taking someone to dinner to impress them vs. taking them to dinner to spend quality time with them)
5. What are my core values? (*kindness, compassion, care, recognizing the divine in the mundane*)

#### My values
1. **Morality** (based on *Christian guilt*). Good: live an ethical life, Bad: creates judging of others.
2. **Honesty**
3. **Integrity**
4. **Co-dependence** (my happiness is based on things outside myself)
5. **Courage**

#### Things I feel good doing
1. Learning
2. Helping others
3. Making art

#### Ideas from other group members
1. 40 bags in 40 days (donating 40 bags of clutter to the local thrift store)
2. Mindful eating (tasting your food, reflecting on everything that went into it)
3. Saying what I mean, but in a nice way (no passive-aggressiveness)
4. Meaning what I say
5. Being honest with myself

### Afternoon Lecture
It's okay to feel good _about_ something that also makes you _feel good_.

**Put yourself first - but in a non-selfish, non-codependent way.** The only way you can help others is to take care of yourself first. For example, on an airplane they tell parents to put on their own oxygen mask first before helping their children in the case of an emergency. This is because if the parent doesn't put their own on first and passes out, they won't be able to help their child.

**Sometimes the most compassionate thing you can do for someone is to let them fall**, rather than rescuing them or bailing them out. Especially where addiction is concerned, people generally have to reach rock bottom before they are willing to make a change. We learn the best lessons from making mistakes.

In the beginning, we go to AA (12 Step Groups) to get what *we* need to stay sober. And then, as we grow, we go to a meeting to see what we can *add to it*. This is where we shift from taking care of ourselves to being of service to others.

**If you don't have it, you can give it to someone else. But the only way to keep what you have is to give it away.**

It takes a lot of bravery and courage to open up and talk about your feelings. Even more to *show up* for yourself.

#### Motivation vs. Intent
Motivation is unconscious and motivated by outside stimuli. Intention is a conscious decision. Intention can cut through motivation.

**Example:** the motivation to eat a cookie (craving) versus the intention to eat healthy on your diet.

To learn patience, you have to work on it when you're <u>not</u> in a high stress situation. This is so that you can have the patience available when you require it. It is the same with compassion and mindfulness.

You need to water the seeds of compassion or intention when everything is going good, so it's available when everything isn't going good.

The key to life is being proactive rather than reactive.

The energy of mindfulness is kind, compassionate and caring.

We're programmed to think that everyone else has it together - while we are damaged goods.

Our first mental reaction is anger / blame / negative. We expect perfection in ourselves (and others). But inherently, we are kind, compassionate and self-healing.

### Afternoon Breakout Session
> What are the labels I add to myself that keep me from realizing my full potential?

#### Me
**Label:** Not enough

- Fat
- Ugly
- Bad at sports
- Bad at dancing
- Socially awkward
- Unlovable / undesirable
- "Everyone always leaves"
- Poor leader
- Uncool
- Introvert

#### Second Speaker
**Label:** Introvert

- Introvert (hates small talk)
- Damaged goods (abusive household growing up)
- Self-will

Self-will disconnects her from her higher power.

**Formula For Re-Connecting**
1. Courage (**Taking Risks**)
2. Turning it over to God (**Trust**)
3. Accepting the outcome (**Humility**)
4. Looking at it again / re-evaluating (**Sanity**)

This helps her to replace self-will for a better connection with God.

#### Third Speaker
**Label:** Emotionally indifferent

- Family without emotion
 - Nowhere safe to express feelings
 - No one cares, *just get over it*
 - Showing emotion = weakness
 - It has been a challenge in her sobreity to learn to be real and vulnerable
- "Not good enough"
- "Nothing interesting to say"
- "Not worthy"

#### Fourth Speaker
**Label:** Friendly, outgoing and spiritual, but with a "fuck you" attitude

- "Fuck you" attitude = defense mechanism
- If you act like you don't care, you can't get hurt
- "Porchupine outside, marshmellow inside"
- Kind, loving & spiritual but also a strong, independent Irish woman who never gives up or gives in. **Never asks for help.** Runs on self-will.

She feels like everyone else got the manual of how to live life, but she wasn't present that day. But she has come to see the 12-Steps as the manual or blueprint of how to live life.

#### Fifth Speaker
**Label:** Strong, independent, macho man

**Question:** Are we ever able to truly overcome things we learned as a child?

- Never allowed to ask for help
- Never allowed to show vulnerability
- Anything less than an A in school was failure
- Feels inferior and insufficient
- Feels "less" than you are
- Wants to learn how to let the inferioriry complex go and be free

**Expectations** = pre-meditated resentments

**Expectation** = expect to be let down

When things go South, humans like to blame someone else. Because if you blame someone, then you can be angry at them and you don't have to feel grief. Anything is easier than having to truly get in touch with our feelings, especially grief.

**God + Son** = The energy of the divine
**Holy Spirit** = The manifestation of that love in each of use

<u>Service is love</u>. Feeling nourished = collective energy of mindfulness = holy spirit = Buddhanature.

#### Realizations

There is no separation between me and the divine. There isn't between others and the divine either. Therefore, me = others = divine. **Equanimity**.

The energy of mindfulness is love in action and comes from my inner self. Once you get the ego out of the equation.

I am not my ego. Thoughts, desires, etc are just things that arise. They aren't inherently me.

We're not better than anyone else - but we're also not less than anyone else.

Being *okay* requires huility. When you're not trying to protect your ego, you can just be.

Removing labels that are limiting us allows us to detach from the ego.

**E.G.O. = Edging God Out**
- Fear, inadequacy, shame, unworthiness
- Leads to isolation and constriction - based upon a lie. It's not who we really are.

**The labels we assign ourselves become a self-fulfilling prophecy**

<u>What is my purpose?</u> To help people. And to live an ethical and honest life.

**Higher Power**
<u>UPS Driver</u> - <u>U</u>niversal <u>P</u>ower <u>S</u>ource - delivers everyday as long as I pray and meditate.
